# Google map test configuration

In order to pass the test, you MUST define an environment variable called 
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY. It must contain a valid google maps API key.

This variable will replace the placeholder <YOUR_API_KEY> used in file 
test_content/map.js.tst_template to generate the file map.js that is expected
in test_content/index.html
